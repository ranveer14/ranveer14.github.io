title: "Free-will of a Materialist"
---
 
The idea of free-will has been an ancient philosophical conundrums posed to mankind. There have been several desperate attemps to settle this question- all without a culmination.    
Philosophies all across mankind has many fold divergences but the one at forefront is the materialist reductionist approach to life. Most of the scientific community as well as well off members of the society concoct to such a stand. Never has science tried to investigate the subject itself. All the endeavour of
science has been to reduce the problems to objects of study and then propose an explanation. But what if there is something which cannot be made into an object. Consider the scientist himself as a conscious being. Free-wll is such an issue. The basis of mathematics, which is considered the purest of sciences, is
logic. It is clear that if two ideas are logically contradicting then one of the two must be false and should be given up.   
Freewill is the notion that the actions and decisions taken by a conscious individual is purely motivated by his choice and not due to an external factor. This also means that at every instant of life, one is “free” to choose among several possible choices and that no-one not even the so called “god” of religion
is aware of the individuals choice unless the action in done. Such a strict notion of freewill on one hand is in direct contrast to the god centred religions of the world but are also contradictory to the very choice of being a materialist which most of the people chose to become. In essense, no man is truely a materialist. There are several arguments in favour of this fact. One possible argument is
that every individual cherishes the birth of a baby in his/her family knowing fully well that in future it is going to cost lakhs towards the proper development of the child. If an individual was really
a hardcore materialist, he wouldn’t care about anyone else but himself. There are other arguments as well but this post is not to give arguments in favour or against of materialism but to eastablish a logical fallacy in the intuitive nature of freewill and meterialism.
