> What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that its just ain't so - Mark Twain. 
Most of us are into the illusions of knowing who we are, I will prove it. But who are we really and why does it matter? It does not matter a single bit if you are happy and satisfied with your life. It also does not matter if you are unsatisfied but only on an intellectual level and you would like to know things only to make intellectual conversations. Most of our inquiries begin with the realisation that we know very little and that we don't really have any answers and all these things starts to matter all of a sudden. Most of us start looking for answers when we are stuck into some kind of existential crisis. Its hard to define what an existential crisis is since people have all kinds of experiences. For example, people feel the lack of meaning in life and what they are doing and tend to avoid public exposure. In such a state they fervently seek for meaning and purpose to keep on living their lives. Most of the times people end up asking their own identity. But it does not mean that you need to have existentianl crisis to ask this question. Maybe you will have one knowing that what you think yourself to be is an illusion and a mental construct.     

So let me get to the point. Who are we really? Let us first delve into the understanding that we have. When we ask ourselves about our identity, the first **thought** that pops up in our **mind** is our name and the lineage we belong to. We are so sure of our understanding about oursleves that we seldom question this unless provoked externally. Is this understanding correct. Let me prove to you that your understanding is not correct. Let us first understand the definition of identity and make sure that we agree to the definitions that we are using. 

**Definition** (Personal Identity). Personal identity usually refers to properties to which we feel a special sense of attachment or ownership. Someoneâ€™s personal identity in this sense consists of those properties she takes to _define her as a person_ or _make her the person she is_, and which _distinguish_ her from others.

This is the identity that most people think of when asked about it. But I am not talking about personal identity here. What I am talking about is **existential identity**, which is there independent of the external world and is obviated by the fact that we exist. Why should we care about existential identity when personal identity serves us well in our lives? As I said it does not matter as long as you are engrossed in day to day life as personal identity is all you need to distinguish yourself from others. But as you can sniff, personal identity is very vague and does not already give you the sense of identity at the level of an **observer** because it makes reference to external objects. As we will discover, we cannot define the existential identity
