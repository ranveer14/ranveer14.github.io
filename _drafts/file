When a principal bundle's structure group reduces from SU(N)/Zₙ to SU(2)/Z₂, there's an underlying relationship between their characteristic classes, specifically the Stiefel-Whitney classes. To understand this relationship, let's delve into the properties of these groups and their associated bundles.

**Background on the Groups:**

- **SU(N)/Zₙ**: This is the special unitary group SU(N) modulo its center Zₙ. The center Zₙ consists of scalar multiples of the identity matrix by N-th roots of unity. Modding out by the center essentially removes these scalar matrices, resulting in a group with elements that are more "distinct" in terms of their action on vector spaces.

- **SU(2)/Z₂ ≅ SO(3)**: Similarly, SU(2)/Z₂ is the special unitary group SU(2) modulo its center Z₂, which is isomorphic to the rotation group SO(3). This group acts on 3-dimensional real vector spaces and has well-studied topological properties.

**Stiefel-Whitney Classes:**

Stiefel-Whitney classes are characteristic classes associated with real vector bundles, taking values in cohomology with ℤ₂ coefficients. They provide algebraic invariants that classify vector bundles up to isomorphism.

**The Relationship Between the Bundles:**

When the structure group reduces from SU(N)/Zₙ to SU(2)/Z₂, there's a homomorphism from SU(2)/Z₂ into SU(N)/Zₙ. This homomorphism induces a pullback of characteristic classes from the SU(N)/Zₙ bundle to the SU(2)/Z₂ bundle.

**Key Points:**

1. **Second Stiefel-Whitney Class (w₂):** This class is particularly important because it measures the obstruction to lifting a bundle to a spin structure. For an SO(3) bundle (or SU(2)/Z₂ bundle), w₂ represents the obstruction to lifting it to an SU(2) bundle.

2. **Relation via Pullback:** The second Stiefel-Whitney class of the SU(2)/Z₂ bundle is the pullback of the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the SU(N)/Zₙ bundle via the homomorphism induced by the group inclusion.

3. **Mod 2 Reduction:** The characteristic classes of the SU(N)/Zₙ bundle, when reduced mod 2, correspond to those of the SU(2)/Z₂ bundle. This is because the homomorphism maps elements in a way that preserves the mod 2 cohomology classes.

**Conclusion:**

The relation between the Stiefel-Whitney classes is that the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the SU(2)/Z₂ bundle is equal to the reduction modulo 2 of the corresponding class in the SU(N)/Zₙ bundle. This means that the topology encoded by the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the larger SU(N)/Zₙ bundle manifests in the reduced SU(2)/Z₂ bundle through this mod 2 relationship.

**Answer:**

Because the SU(2)/Z₂ bundle is induced from the SU(N)/Zₙ bundle, their Stiefel-Whitney classes are related by pullback; specifically, the SU(2)/Z₂ bundle’s classes equal the SU(N)/Zₙ bundle’s classes reduced mod 2—that is, the SU(2)/Z₂ bundle’s w₂ equals the SU(N)/Zₙ bundle’s w₂ mod 2.

Certainly! Here's a detailed proof of the relationship between the Stiefel-Whitney classes of an \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \) bundle and those of an \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \) bundle when the structure group reduces from \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \) to \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \).

### **Overview**

We will show that:

- **Statement**: When the structure group of a principal \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \) bundle reduces to \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \), the second Stiefel-Whitney class \( w_2 \) of the \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \) bundle is equal to the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the original \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \) bundle pulled back via the inclusion homomorphism. That is, \( w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2} = w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N} \).

### **Background Concepts**

1. **Principal Bundles and Structure Group Reduction**:
   - A principal \( G \)-bundle \( P \) over a manifold \( X \) has a structure group \( G \).
   - If \( H \subset G \) is a subgroup, and the transition functions of \( P \) can be chosen to lie in \( H \), then the structure group of \( P \) reduces to \( H \).

2. **Characteristic Classes**:
   - **Stiefel-Whitney Classes** \( w_i \) are characteristic classes associated with real vector bundles, with values in \( H^i(X, \mathbb{Z}_2) \).
   - These classes measure the topological twisting of the bundle.

3. **Classifying Spaces**:
   - Every principal \( G \)-bundle over \( X \) corresponds to a homotopy class of maps \( f: X \to BG \), where \( BG \) is the classifying space of \( G \).
   - Characteristic classes can be defined as pullbacks of universal classes in \( H^*(BG, R) \) via \( f \).

4. **Group Homomorphisms and Induced Maps**:
   - A group homomorphism \( \phi: H \to G \) induces a map between classifying spaces \( B\phi: BH \to BG \).
   - This, in turn, induces a pullback on cohomology \( \phi^*: H^*(BG, R) \to H^*(BH, R) \).

### **The Proof**

#### **Step 1: Establish the Group Homomorphism**

- **Inclusion Homomorphism**:
  - Consider the natural inclusion \( \iota: \mathrm{SU}(2) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{SU}(N) \), where \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \) is embedded in \( \mathrm{SU}(N) \) (e.g., in the upper-left \( 2 \times 2 \) block).
  - This inclusion induces a homomorphism between the quotient groups:
    \[ \phi: \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \to \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \]

#### **Step 2: Induced Maps on Classifying Spaces**

- **Maps Between Classifying Spaces**:
  - The homomorphism \( \phi \) induces a continuous map between classifying spaces:
    \[ B\phi: B(\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2) \to B(\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N) \]
  - This map reflects how \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \)-bundles relate to \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \)-bundles.

#### **Step 3: Relationship Between Bundles**

- **Reduced Structure Group**:
  - Let \( P \) be a principal \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \)-bundle over \( X \).
  - Suppose the structure group reduces to \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \) via \( \phi \), resulting in a principal \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \)-bundle \( Q \).

- **Classifying Maps**:
  - The \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \)-bundle \( P \) has a classifying map \( f: X \to B(\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N) \).
  - The \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \)-bundle \( Q \) has a classifying map \( g: X \to B(\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2) \).

- **Composition**:
  - Since \( Q \) corresponds to \( P \) under the reduction, the following holds:
    \[ f = B\phi \circ g \]

#### **Step 4: Pullback of Characteristic Classes**

- **Universal Stiefel-Whitney Classes**:
  - Let \( w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N} \in H^2(B(\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N), \mathbb{Z}_2) \) be the universal second Stiefel-Whitney class.
  - Similarly, \( w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2} \in H^2(B(\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2), \mathbb{Z}_2) \).

- **Pullback via \( B\phi \)**:
  - The map \( B\phi \) induces a pullback on cohomology:
    \[ (B\phi)^*: H^2(B(\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N), \mathbb{Z}_2) \to H^2(B(\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2), \mathbb{Z}_2) \]
  - Therefore:
    \[ w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2} = (B\phi)^*(w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N}) \]

#### **Step 5: Relate the Stiefel-Whitney Classes of the Bundles**

- **Characteristic Classes of \( Q \)**:
  - The second Stiefel-Whitney class of \( Q \) is:
    \[ w_2(Q) = g^*(w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2}) \]

- **Substitute \( w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2} \)**:
  - Using the result from Step 4:
    \[ w_2(Q) = g^*\left( (B\phi)^*(w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N}) \right) \]

- **Composition of Pullbacks**:
  - Since \( f = B\phi \circ g \), the pullback along \( f \) is:
    \[ f^* = g^* \circ (B\phi)^* \]

- **Conclude the Equality**:
  - Therefore:
    \[ w_2(Q) = f^*(w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N}) \]
  - But \( f^*(w_2^{\mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N}) \) is the second Stiefel-Whitney class of \( P \):
    \[ w_2(Q) = w_2(P) \]

#### **Step 6: Interpretation**

- **Equality of Stiefel-Whitney Classes**:
  - The second Stiefel-Whitney class is preserved under the reduction of the structure group from \( \mathrm{SU}(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N \) to \( \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \).

- **Mod 2 Relation**:
  - Since Stiefel-Whitney classes take values in \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) cohomology, any integral characteristic classes pulled back will be reduced modulo 2.

### **Conclusion**

**Answer:**

**Proof:**
When the structure group reduces from SU(N)/ℤₙ to SU(2)/ℤ₂ via the inclusion homomorphism φ: SU(2)/ℤ₂ → SU(N)/ℤₙ, this induces a map between their classifying spaces Bφ: B(SU(2)/ℤ₂) → B(SU(N)/ℤₙ). The second Stiefel-Whitney class w₂ of the SU(2)/ℤ₂ bundle is the pullback of the SU(N)/ℤₙ bundle’s w₂ under this map—that is, w₂(SU(2)/ℤ₂ bundle) = Bφ* w₂(SU(N)/ℤₙ bundle). Therefore, w₂ is preserved under the reduction, showing that the SU(2)/ℤ₂ bundle’s w₂ equals that of the SU(N)/ℤₙ bundle.
