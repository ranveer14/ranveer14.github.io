#### About me  

* Hi! I am Ranveer Kumar Singh. I am a mathematician by training and a theoretical physicist by practice. My research interests include number theory, automorphic forms and string theory. To be precise, I am interested in the underpinnings of string theory and pure mathematics. To discover more about my academic interests, please go to [Research](https://ranveer14.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"}.   
* I completed BSMS integrated course majoring in mathematics and with a minor in physics from [IISER Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, India and currently pursuing Phd in theoretical physics at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
* During my coursework at IISER Bhopal, I completed courses on Group Theory, Linear Algebra, Rings and Modules, Real and Complex Analysis, Manifolds, Lie groups and Lie Algebras, Galois Theory, Analytic Number Theory and Modular Forms and many other courses in Mathematics. In Physics, I mainly studied theoretical courses including Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Physics, Qunatum Field Theory, General Relativity, Particle Physics, Electrodynamics and some other courses. To know more about my academic profile, look at [my CV](Ranveer_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}.   
* I completed my master's research in mathematics under the supervision of [Dr. Ajit Bhand](https://home.iiserb.ac.in/~abhand/){:target="_blank"}. My Thesis was aimed at investigating the connections of some of the classical objects in number theory, for example modular forms, class groups and mock modular forms, with black hole microstates in  string theory. Here is my [Master's Thesis](MS_Thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  
* Currently I am working on two projects, one with [Dr. Nabamita Banerjee](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~nabamita/){:target="_blank"} and the other with [Prof. Gregory Moore](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/){:target="_blank"}. The aim of the first project is to study soft and collinear limits in Super Yang-Mills Theory and Supergravity and use it along with techniques from 2d CFT to compute asymptotic symmetries of these theories. The second project is to understand Monstrous Moonshine and its applications in superconformal field theories.  
 
I am mainly driven by my desire to comprehend the truth of existence which manifests itself in the language of mathematics and physics although not limited to it. This aroused my interest in philosophies of the east and the west. I have been influenced by the western philosophical giants like Friedrich Nietzsche, Bertrand Russel, Soren Kierkagaard, Sigmund Freud and many others. Eastern philosophy has also imprinted its mark on my thinking, most notably the ideas of Vedanta as expounded by Adi Shankara, Vivekananda and Ramanna Maharshi. I am particularly interested in the scientific and rigorous approach Buddhism has towards the discovery of truth. I have exposed myself to other eastern philosophies as well like Taoism, Zen and so on.
