#### About me  

* Hi! I am Ranveer Kumar Singh. I am a graduate student in the New High Energy Theory Center (NHETC) working under the supervision of [Prof. Gregory Moore](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/){:target="_blank"}, department of physics and astronomy at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"}.  My research interest is theoretical high energy physics and number theory. To know more about my interests, go to [Research](https://ranveer14.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"}.   
* I completed BSMS integrated masters course majoring in mathematics and with a minor in physics from [IISER Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, India. My master's research in mathematics was under the supervision of [Dr. Ajit Bhand](https://home.iiserb.ac.in/~abhand/){:target="_blank"}. My Thesis was aimed at investigating the connections of modular forms, class groups and mock modular forms, with black hole microstates counting problem in string theory. Here is my [Master's Thesis](MS_Thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
