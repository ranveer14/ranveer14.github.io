## About me
Hi! I am Ranveer Kumar Singh. I am a mathematician by training and a theoretical physicist by practice. By profession I am theoretical physicist but my interests are not limited to just mathematics and physics, I am also interested in western and estern philosophy. I think knowing oneself is the way to knowing the universe.
