#### About me  

* Hi! I am Ranveer Kumar Singh. I am a mathematician by training and a theoretical physicist by practice. My research interests include number theory, automorphic forms and string theory. To be precise, I am interested in the underpinnings of string theory and pure mathematics. To discover more about my academic interests, please go to [Research](https://ranveer14.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"}.   
* I completed BSMS integrated course majoring in mathematics and with a minor in physics from [IISER Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, India. During my coursework, I completed courses on Group Theory, Linear Algebra, Rings and Modules, Real and Complex Analysis, Manifolds, Lie groups and Lie Algebras, Galois Theory, Analytic Number Theory and Modular Forms and many other courses in Mathematics. In Physics, I mainly studied theoretical courses including Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Physics, Qunatum Field Theory, General Relativity, Particle Physics Electrodynamics and some other courses. To know more about my academic profile, look at [my CV](ranveer_cv_1oct_2020.pdf){:target="_blank"}.   
* I completed my master's research in mathematics under the supervision of [Dr. Ajit Bhand](https://home.iiserb.ac.in/~abhand/){:target="_blank"}. My Thesis was aimed at investigating the connections of some of the classical objects in number theory, modular forms, class groups and mock modular forms for example, with black hole microstates in  string theory. Here is my [Master's Thesis](MS_Thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  
* Currently I am working on a project with [Dr. Suvankar Dutta](https://home.iiserb.ac.in/~suvankar/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Nabamita Banerjee](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~nabamita/){:target="_blank"}. The aim of the project is to understand the work of Dabholkar, Murthy and Zagier (DMZ) on the mock modular behaviour of partition function of single centered black holes in Type IIB string theories. Here is the [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4074){:target="_blank"} to DMZ's paper. Additionally, I am giving presentations on introductory string theory to string theory research group at IISER Bhopal. You can find the notes of the lectures [here](https://ranveer14.github.io/string-theory-notes.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 
 
I am mainly driven by my desire to comprehend the truth of existence which manifests itself in the language of mathematics and physics although not limited to it. This aroused my interest in philosophies of the east and the west. I have been influenced by the western philosophical giants like Friedrich Nietzsche, Bertrand Russel, Soren Kierkagaard, Sigmund Freud and many others. Eastern philosophy has also imprinted its mark on my thinking, most notably the ideas of Vedanta as expounded by Adi Shankara, Vivekananda and Ramanna Maharshi, Buddhism in the spirit of S.N. Goenka. I have also been exposed to other eastern philosophies as well like Taoism, Zen and so on.
