#### Number Theory and Automorphic Forms  
The theory of automorphic forms finds wide ranging applications, from partition theory to black hole physics. For example, modular forms, Jacobi forms, Siegel modular forms and more recently mock modular forms has appeared in context of string theory. I am mainly interested in modular forms, the theory of harmonic Maass forms and mock modular forms. I am also interested in some topics of algebraic number theory, the theory of quadratic fields and class group.  
#### String Theory  
My interests include, but is not limited to, the applications of number theory in string theory. In particular, black holes in generic string theories involve partition functions which are in general Siegel modular forms for some subgroup of the Siegel modular group. My interests lie at the physical aspects of the mathematical results and vice-versa.
